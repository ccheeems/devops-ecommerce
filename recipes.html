        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <strong>Base</strong>
        <p>1 cup raw almonds <br>
        ½ cup shredded coconut <br>
        ¾ cup dates, soaked in water for 2 hours <br>
        1 tsp ground cinnamon <br>
        Pinch any good quality salt</p>
        <strong>Filling</strong>
        <p>2 cups thick scoopable canned coconut cream <br>
        ½ cup almond butter <br>
        ¼ cup coconut sugar <br>
        2 ½ tsp agar agar + ½ cup water <br>
        1 cup fresh blueberries </p>
        <strong>Jelly Topping</strong>
        <p>½ cup fresh or frozen blueberries <br>
        2 cups water <br>
        3 tbsp any light-coloured sweetener, such as rice malt syrup or maple syrup, (optional) <br>
        2 tsp agar powder </p>
        <strong>To Serve</strong>
        <p>½ cup fresh blueberries</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. For the base, process almonds and coconut in a food processor until it forms coarse crumbs. Drain dates and add with cinnamon and salt to the food processor. Process until combined. Press into a lined loaf tin or container around the same size. <br>
        2. For the filling, add the cream, almond butter and coconut sugar to a mixing bowl and mix until combined. <br>
        3. Add almond mixture, agar agar and water to a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix, bring to a gentle boil or until just thickened then remove from heat. <br>
        4. Pour mixture over the crust and press blueberries into the top of the mixture. Set aside in the fridge. <br>
        5. When the almond filling is dry to the touch, you can start making the blueberry jelly. Add all jelly ingredients to a small saucepan over medium heat. Mash the blueberries with a fork and bring to a gentle boil. Remove from heat then drain mixture to separate blueberry pulp from liquid (reserve the pulp to add to smoothies etc). Pour blueberry jelly on top of the almond filling. <br>
        6. Set aside in the fridge until set (around 4 hours). Remove from tin/container and slice with a wet knife. Serve with fresh blueberries on top. Store slices in airtight container the fridge for up to 5 days. Slices cannot be stored in the freezer as the jelly will separate when you defrost it. </p>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <p>12 egg whites <br>
        1 1/2 tsp cream of tartar <br>
        315g (1 1/2 cups) caster sugar <br>
        150g (1 cup) self-raising flour <br>
        Pink food colouring, to tint <br>
        300g (2 cups) icing sugar <br>
        2 tbsp water <br>
        1 tsp rose water
        </p>
        <strong>Sugared Rose Petals</strong>
        <p>1 medium pink unsprayed rose <br>
        1 egg white <br>
        100g (1/2 cup) caster sugar 
        </p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. For the sugared rose petals, line a tray with baking paper. Carefully peel off rose petals , selecting medium, nicely-shaped petals. Lightly whisk egg white until slightly foamy. Brush petals lightly with egg white. Sprinkle with sugar and shake off excess. Place on prepared tray and set aside for 2-3 hours to dry. <br>
        2. Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Use electric beaters to beat egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until soft peaks form. Beat in the cream of tartar until just combined. Gradually add 155g (3/4 cup) of the sugar , in 4 batches, beating well after each addition until sugar dissolves. Sift flour and remaining sugar together 3 times. Gently fold flour mixture and a little food colouring into egg white mixture. Spread mixture into a 21cm (base measurement) ungreased angel food cake pan (see Notes). Smooth the surface and wipe side of pan clean. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until mixture springs back slightly when touched. <br>
        3. Immediately invert the pan onto a wire rack (see Notes). Allow the cake to cool completely in pan. Once cool, gently run a palette knife around both sides of the pan to loosen cake. Gently ease the cake out of the pan. Place upside down on serving plate. <br>
        4. Combine the icing sugar , water and rosewater in a heatproof bowl. Place bowl over a pan of simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Cook, stirring, until smooth and mixture is the consistency of pouring cream. Tint pale pink with food colouring. Drizzle icing over top of cake, allowing icing to drip down the side. Set aside to set. Decorate with sugared rose petals.

        1/2 cup sugar <br>
        1/3 cup Kirsche 
        </p>
        <strong>Whipped Cream Frosting</strong>
        <p>1 1/2 pints heavy cream cold <br>
        1/3 cup powdered sugar plus more to taste <br>
        1 1/2 tbsp Kirsche
        </p>
        <strong>Assembly</strong>
        <p>2 cups cherries (plus more for decorating) <br>
        1 bittersweet chocolate
        </p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For the Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Butter and flour 3 six inch cake pans. Preheat oven to 350F. <br>
        2. Sift the flour baking soda and powder, salt and cocoa powder. <br>
        3. Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat the eggs and yolks in one at a time, then add in the coffee. <br>
        4. In three batches, mix in the flour mixture alternating with the buttermilk. Don't over-mix! <br>
        5. Divide batter evenly into pans and bake at 350f for about 25 - 30 minutes or until the centers are done. Allow to cool in pans for about 10 minutes and then invert onto a wire rack. 
        </p>
        <strong>For the Syrup</strong>
        <p>1. Add the water and sugar to a small pot then bring to a boil. Allow to boil for about a minute then remove from heat and stir in the cherry liqueur. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool before using. 
        </p>
        <strong>For the Whipped Cream Frosting</strong>
        <p>1. Add the cold cream, powdered sugar, and Kirsche to the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment then beat on high until soft peaks form. I always chill my bowl and whisk for a fast whip but this is optional.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Assembly</strong>
        <p>1. Melt about 1/4 cup or dark chocolate with two tablespoons of cream. Whisk together and set aside. <br>
        2. Wash, halve and pit about about 2 cups of cherries then transfer to a bowl and set aside. <br>
        3. Carefully shave the chocolate using a knife or vegetable peeler. and set aside. <br>
        4. Cover the first cake layer with whipped cream then press cherry halves all over the top. These cherry pieces are actually structural as they will hold the cake up, whipped cream is TOO soft for a three layer cake on it's own. Repeat the process with the other layers until the cake is assembled. <br>
        5. Give the cake a quick smooth and push in any errant cherries. Cover the cake with more whipped cream then smooth the top and side. <br>
        6. Gingerly press shaved chocolate onto the bottom half of the cake. You can also toss the chocolate at the cake as the frosting is quite soft and easy to disturb. <br>
        7. Pour or pipe ganache onto the cake's top then smooth out. Leave about an inch from the edge uncovered. <br>
        8. Transfer the remaining whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a large closed star tip Pipe dollops on the top then top with cherries.

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <strong>Ganache</strong>
        <p>270ml double cream <br>
        70g butter, cubed <br>
        3½ tbsp clear honey <br>
        270g dark chocolate, chopped
        </p>
        <strong>Devil Cake</strong>
        <p>200g butter, plus extra for greasing <br>
        75g cocoa powder <br>
        200g caster sugar <br>
        175g light muscovado sugar <br>
        1 tbsp vanilla extract <br>
        3 large eggs <br>
        100ml soured cream <br>
        335g plain flour <br>
        1 tsp baking powder <br>
        1 tsp bicarbonate of soda <br>
        ½ tsp salt 
        </p>
        <strong>Decorate (Optional)</strong>
        <p>250g ready to roll coloured red icing</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Grease and line 3 x 20cm sandwich cake tins with baking paper. Make the ganache by putting the double cream into a large pan over a medium heat. Bring just to the boil, then remove from the heat. <br>
        2. Add the butter, honey and chocolate and leave for 2 mins to melt, then stir until smooth. Set aside to cool and thicken, then store in the fridge until needed. <br>
        3. Meanwhile, put the cocoa powder for the cakes into a bowl and whisk in 275ml boiling water until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. In a separate bowl, beat together the butter, both sugars and vanilla extract until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. <br>
        4. Stir the soured cream into the cooled cocoa powder mixture. Mix together the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt in another bowl. Fold a third of the dry ingredients into the butter mixture, followed by a third of the cocoa mixture, continuing until everything is combined as a smooth batter. <br>
        5. Divide the batter between the 3 tins and smooth the surface of each. Bake for 25-30 mins or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins in the tins, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely. <br>
        6. To assemble, remove the ganache from the fridge - it should be thick enough to spread over the cakes, but if too stiff, stir briefly to loosen. Put one cake on a serving plate and spread over a quarter of the ganache. Top with the second cake and another quarter of the ganache. Finish with the third cake and spread the remaining ganache over the top and down the sides of the chocolate cake. <br>
        7. To decorate for Halloween, take a pack of ready-to-roll red icing and divide in half. Cut one piece in half again and shape into 2 pointy devil horns. Push into the top of the cake to secure in place. Take a third of the remaining icing and form into a triangle. Roll the rest into a long rope shape and wrap around from the back of the cake to the front for the tail, pressing into the sides of the cake to secure. Add the triangle for the end of the tail, then cut into slices to serve. <br>
        <b>Tip:</b> If not decorating for Halloween, use a palette knife to swirl the ganache icing around the top and sides to create a textured pattern. You could also add chocolate curls or shavings to decorate, if you like.

        1 cup chopped pecans, toasted! <br>
        8 oz crushed pineapple <br>
        2 bananas 
        </p>
        <strong>Frosting</strong>
        <p>16 oz cream cheese <br>
        1 cup butter <br>
        1 tsp vanilla 5mL <br>
        1 3/4 lb confectioners sugar
        </p>
        <strong>Pineapple Flowers</strong>
        <p>1 pineapple</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For the Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut parchment rounds for your pans and butter and flour the sides. You can make this cake with two eight inch pans or three six inch pans. If using the smaller pans you will have enough extra batter for a few cupcakes. <br>
        2. Sift the flour, baking soda, salt and spices into a large bowl then whisk together and set aside. <br>
        3. Peel and mash your bananas in a small bowl. <br>
        4. Beat the sugars, oil, eggs, sour cream, and vanilla together in a large bowl. <br>
        5. Mix in the crushed pineapple, mashed bananas, and toasted pecan pieces into the wet mixture. <br>
        6. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Mix together until combined and scrape the bowl down. <br>
        7. Divide the batter evenly into two buttered 8" pans lined with parchment paper. You can also make this recipe with 3 six inch pans. If doing so you may will have enough extra batter for a few cupcakes. <br>
        8. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. <br>
        9. Allow the layers to cool completely in the pan for about 5 minutes then invert onto a wire rack. Remove parchment paper and allow to cool completely.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Cream Cheese Frosting</strong>
        <p>1. Cream the butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Scrape the bowl down then add the confectioners sugar a few cups at a time and mix until smooth.</p>
        <strong>For the Pineapple Flowers</strong>
        <p>1. Set oven to 220F. Cut the skin from a whole pineapple and remove the "eyes". Use a sharp knife to cut very thin slices. <br>
        2. Pat each slice dry with paper towels and place on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper. <br>
        3. Bake For 30 minutes then flip slices and place back in oven. Bake until most water is gone and the slices have shrunken. You will notice the pineapple has darkened to a golden brown when they are ready. <br>
        4. Place each slice in a mini muffin tin and press the center down. Allow to dry/set overnight.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Assembly</strong>
        <p>1. Pipe a thick layer of the cream cheese frosting onto the first cooled layer, add the second then repeat the process until the cake is built. Because cream cheese frosting tends to be soft it's best to chill the cake for a bit so it stabilizes. <br>
        2. Cover the cake in cream cheese frosting then smooth the side and top. <br>
        3. Press the chopped toasted pecans onto the lower part of the side. <br>
        4. Apply the pineapple flowers to the top of the cake. You can pipe a mound of frosting on the cake first to give the flowers some play of height.

        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. To make the cake, preheat an oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, then grease the parchment. <br>
        2. In a bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. <br>
        3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the granulated sugar, egg, egg yolk, buttermilk, oil and vanilla on medium speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, slowly add the flour mixture and beat until combined, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the melted chocolate and espresso powder and beat until combined. Raise the speed to high and beat for 20 seconds. <br>
        4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool completely. Remove the outer ring of the springform pan and set aside. <br>
        5. To make the ganache filling, in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 3/4 cup of the cream to a boil. Place 5 oz. of the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes, then whisk to combine. Let cool completely. <br>
        6. To make the strawberry layer, in the clean bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the clean paddle attachment, beat together the cream cheese and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until combined. Add the milk and food coloring and beat for 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and wash and dry the mixer bowl. <br>
        7. Pour the cream into the mixer bowl, fit the mixer with the whisk attachment, and beat on medium-high speed until medium to stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture, then fold in the strawberries. Set aside. <br>
        8. To make the vanilla layer, in the clean bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the clean paddle attachment, beat together the cream cheese and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until combined. Add the milk, vanilla extract and vanilla bean seeds and beat for 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and wash and dry the mixer bowl. Pour the cream into the mixer bowl, fit the mixer with the clean whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until medium to stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Set aside. <br>
        9. To assemble the cake, line the sides of the springform pan with parchment paper so that the parchment extends about 4 inches above the top of the pan. Using a large serrated knife, cut the cake in half horizontally. Place one half in the pan. Spread half of the ganache evenly over the cake, then spread the strawberry filling over the top. Place the second half of the cake and spread with the remaining ganache, then spread the vanilla filling evenly on top. Freeze for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. <br>
        10. Remove the cake from the pan and remove the parchment. Place the cake on a cake stand or serving plate. <br>
        11. To make the whipped cream icing, in the clean bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the clean whisk attachment, beat together the cream, confectioners' sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Spread the whipped cream over the cake. Freeze until ready to serve, at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. <br>
        12. Just before serving, make the ganache topping: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the remaining 3/4 cup cream to a boil. Place the remaining 6 oz. chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes, then whisk to combine. Let cool slightly. Remove the cake from the freezer and pour the ganache over the top, allowing some of it to drip over the sides. This will happen quickly since the cake is frozen. Scoop vanilla ice cream into the cone and cover with sprinkles. Place it upside down on top of the cake, holding it for a few seconds until it stays. Decorate the top of the cake with sprinkles. The cake can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the freezer for up to 1 week. Serves 16 to 20.

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <strong>Sponge Cake</strong>
        <p>1 cup almond flour <br>
        3/4 cup confectioners' sugar <br>
        1/4 cup all purpose flour <br>
        3 eggs <br>
        1 egg yolk <br>
        3 egg whites <br>
        1/4 cup superfine sugar <br>
        2 tablespoons butter melted
        </p>
        <strong>Coffee Syrup</strong>
        <p>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder <br>
        5 tablespoons warm water <br>
        1/4 cup granulated sugar <br>
        3 tablespoons brandy or cognac
        </p>
        <strong>Coffee Buttercream</strong>
        <p>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder <br>
        1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon water <br>
        3/4 cup granulated sugar <br>
        4 egg yolks <br>
        1 cup unsalted butter cubed and softened</p>
        <strong>Chocolate Glaze and Topping</strong>
        <p>6 tablespoons unsalted butter <br>
        7 oz. semisweet chocolate chopped fine</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For the Sponge Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 450F. Lightly grease a 17x11 jelly roll pan and line it with parchment; grease the paper (alternatively, use a Silpat and grease the mat). <br>
        2. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the almond flour, confectioners' sugar, all-purpose flour, whole eggs, and egg yolk until combined. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. <br>
        3. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites and fine sugar with an electric hand mixer until a thick, glossy meringue forms. Gently fold the meringue into the almond mixture. Add the melted butter and gently fold again, being careful not to deflate the batter. Pour into the prepared baking pan; spread evenly using an offset spatula. Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the cake springs back when pressed in the center. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. The cake should pull away from the sides of the pan, but if it doesn't, run a knife between the cake edge and the pan to loosen the sponge. <br>
        4. Invert the cake onto a wire rack and carefully peel away the parchment or silicone liner. Conservatively trim away the browned edges of the cake using a small sharp knife. Set aside to cool completely.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Coffee Syrup</strong>
        <p>1. Stir together the espresso powder and 1 tablespoon of the water. Stir until dissolved. Add the remaining water to a saucepan along with the granulated sugar. Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the espresso and brandy or cognac. Let cool to room temperature.</p>
        <strong>For the Coffee Buttercream</strong>
        <p>1. Stir together the espresso powder and 1 tablespoon water until the powder is dissolved. In a saucepan, bring the sugar and remaining water to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Clip a thermometer to the side of the pan and bring to a boil without stirring. Wash down any crystals that may form on the sides of the pan using a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Cook, and bring to 238°F (soft ball candy stage) and remove from the heat. <br>
        2. Beat egg yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment for 1 minute. With the mixer running, add the hot sugar syrup to the yolks in a slow fine stream (avoid getting the syrup on the sides of the bowl, aim for the middle). Add the dissolved espresso mixture and beat at high speed until completely cooled. The mixture may look liquid and not at all like buttercream. This is normal. When the mixing bowl is cool to the touch, switch to the paddle attachment and, with the mixer running, add butter pieces one at a time. The mixture may begin to look curdled - this is normal, keep going. When all of the butter has been added beat on high speed until the mixture comes together in a thick, creamy mass of silky buttercream. Cover and set aside.</p>
        <strong>For the Chocolate Glaze and Topping</strong>
        <p>1. In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter and 6 oz. of the chocolate together (reserve remaining 2 tablespoons/1 oz. of chopped chocolate), about 1 to 1 minute 30 seconds in a standard household microwave. Use a whisk to gently stir the mixture smooth. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of chocolate and whisk until melted. Let stand at room temperature until thickened to spreading consistency, or speed setting by refrigerating. Stir the mixture often if refrigerating.</p>
        <strong>For the Assembly</strong>
        <p>1. Cut the cake evenly into thirds. Place a layer on a serving plate and use a pastry brush to apply an even layer of the coffee syrup. Spread half of the French buttercream over the soaked sponge. Top with a second layer of sponge and brush it with the coffee syrup. Spread half of the chocolate glaze over the soaked sponge. Top with the remaining sponge cake and brush with coffee syrup. Add the remaining French buttercream and spread to the edges. Chill the cake until the buttercream is firm, about 30 minutes. <br>
        2. Reheat the remaining chocolate glaze in the microwave for about 15 seconds or until shiny and pourable but not hot. Pour the glaze over the top of the cake and spread evenly. Chill until firm. <br>
        3. When the cake is firmed, trim away the edges of the cake to neaten. Cut slices evenly into fingers (about 2 inches wide). Decorate as desired, gold laurel instructions follow.</p>

        1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder <br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
        1/2 cup vegetable oil <br>
        7 large egg yolks <br>
        3/4 cup fresh orange juice <br>
        2 tablespoons freshly grated orange zest <br>
        2 teaspoons vanilla <br>
        9 large egg whites <br>
        1 teaspoon cream of tartar
        </p>
        <strong>Whipped Cream Frosting</strong>
        <p>2 cups well-chilled heavy cream <br>
        3 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur <br>
        2 teaspoons freshly grated orange zest <br>
        1/4 cup sugar <br>
        1/4 teaspoon orange-flower water (available at specialty foods shops), or to taste, if desired <br>
        candied mimosa balls and candied violets (both available at specialty foods shops) for garnish if desired <br>
        fresh orange sections, membranes discarded, for garnish if desired
        </p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For the Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Into a large bowl sift together the flour, 3/4 cup of the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt. In a bowl whisk together the oil, the egg yolks, the orange juice, the zest, and the vanilla and whisk the mixture into the flour mixture, whisking until the batter is smooth. In the large bowl of an electric mixer beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are foamy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks. Add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, and beat the whites until they hold stiff glossy peaks. Stir one third of the whites into the batter to lighten it and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, 4 inches deep, with feet and a removable bottom, and bake the cake in the middle of a preheated 325°F. oven for 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean. Invert the pan immediately onto a rack and let the cake cool completely in the pan upside down on the rack. Run a long thin knife around the outer and tube edges of the pan and turn the cake out of the pan onto the rack. Using a serrated knife cut the cake in half horizontally.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Whipped Cream Frosting</strong>
        <p>1. In a large bowl, chilled, with an electric mixer beat together the cream, the Grand Marnier, the zest, the sugar, the orange-flower water, and a pinch of salt until the mixture holds stiff peaks. <br>
        2. Transfer the bottom layer of the cake to a platter, spread some of the frosting on it, and top it with the remaining layer. Spread the remaining frosting on the top layer and side of the cake and garnish the cake with the candied mimosa balls, the candied violets, and the orange sections.

        <strong>Vanilla Cake</strong>
        <p><b>{A}</b> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted cake flour<br>
        1 ½ teaspoons baking powder <br>
        ½ teaspoon salt <br>
        6 tablespoons white sugar<br>
        <b>{B}</b> ¼ cup corn/canola oil <br>

        <b>{C}</b> 4 eggwhites <br>
        ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar <br>
        <b>{D}</b> 6 tablespoons white sugar
        </p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For the Chocolate Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 175 degrees Celsius. <br>
        2. In a large bowl, combine {A} well. Add in {B}. Beat with electric mixer or by hand until smooth and well blended.
        3. In a separate bowl, beat {C} on high speed until frothy. Gradually add in the sugar {D} and beat until stiff peaks are formed. Gradually and gently fold in egg whites into egg yolk mixture. Pour batter into an ungreased 8” round, 3” high pan.
        4. Bake for about 50 minutes or until top springs back when lightly touched. Invert pan into wire rack immediately and cool completely.
        5. To release cake from pan, carefully run a thin knife around sides of pan and invert onto your cake board or plate. <br><br>
        <b>Tip 1:</b>
        To transform the vanilla chiffon cake into an Oreo chiffon cake, you will also need about 6 whole pieces (cream included) of Oreo cookies which you will coarsely chop.  Do not use a food processor or crush the cookies into a fine powder as you want them to be very visible inside the cake.  Once you've made the vanilla chiffon cake batter, gently fold in the chopped cookies then proceed to bake as usual. 
        </p>
        <strong>For the Vanilla Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 170 degrees Celsius. <br>
        2. In a large bowl, combine {A} well. Add in {B}. Beat with electric mixer or by hand until smooth and well blended. <br>
        3. In a separate bowl, beat {C} on high speed until frothy. Gradually add in the sugar {D} and beat until stiff peaks are formed. Gradually and gently fold in egg whites into egg yolk mixture. Pour batter into an ungreased 8” round, 3” high pan. <br>
        4. Bake for about 50 minutes or until top springs back when lightly touched. Invert pan into wire rack immediately and cool completely. <br>
        5. To release cake from pan, carefully run a thin knife around sides of pan and invert cake onto a large serving plate. <br><br>
        <b>Tip 2:</b> For easier handling, wrap your cake very well in cling film, then refrigerate overnight before frosting.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Chocolate Ganache</strong>
        <p>1. Place chocolate chips in a medium bowl. <br>
        2. In a small saucepan, bring whipping cream to a boil.  Pour over the chocolate chips and let stand for 1-2 minutes without stirring.
        3. Stir with a whisk until smooth and shiny. <br>
        NOTE: You will use this ganache in two stages.  First, while it is still in its pourable state and second, when it has thickened enough for piping.</p>
        <strong>For the Whipped Cream Frosting</strong>
        <p>1. Cut up the cream cheese into small cubes.  In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Set aside. <br>
        2. In your chilled bowl and using clean beaters, beat the whipping cream, sugar and vanilla until the mixture is quite stiff. Gently fold in the cream cheese then beat again at high speed for about 45 seconds or until everything is well combined. Be careful not to overbeat.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Assembly</strong>
        <p>1. Cut the two chiffon cakes in half horizontally.  Preferably, use the bottom layers of each cake.  Set aside the two extra layers from each cake. (If you want, you can use 3/4 or even the whole Oreo cake rather than cutting it in half to more or less get the same look as the ice cream cake where the top layer is thicker.) <br>
        2. Place a layer of chocolate cake on your cake board, cut side up.  Spread some of the whipped cream. Top with the Oreo vanilla cake, cut side down (or if using the whole cake, bottom side of the cake up). <br>
        3. Cover the whole cake with whipped cream.  Place the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.  Pipe 8-10 equally-spaced big stars around the cake top, leaving about an inch allowance all around for the ganache borders and drizzles. <br>
        4. To do the drizzles, you will need to use your ganache when it has cooled down but still in its liquid form.  Place some of the ganache in a piping bag.  Snip a little bit off the end.  Drizzle some of it on top of the whipped cream stars and then around the cake edge. <br>
        5. Set aside your cake in the fridge while you wait for the remaining ganache to thicken.  You can either leave it at room temperature or put it in the fridge to speed up the process.  Just don't let it harden or else you will have to heat it up again! <br>
        6. When the ganache is ready, mix it gently with a spoon then place it in a piping bag fitted with a star tip.  Pipe a shell border around the top and bottom of the cake. <br>
        7. To finish off, insert Oreo cookies in between the whipped cream stars on the cake top.</p>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <strong>Cheesecake Crust</strong>
        <p>225 g (2 ¼ cups) finely crushed digestive biscuits (You can also use graham crackers. If you need the cheesecake to be gluten free, you can use gluten free digestives or rich tea biscuits, or other gluten free cookies/biscuits of choice.) <br>
        75 g (⅔ stick) unsalted butter, melted (The exact amount of butter you will need will depend on the type of biscuits/cookies/crackers you use.)
        </p>
        <strong>Raspberry Cheesecake Filling</strong>
        <p>400 g (3 ⅓ cups) fresh or frozen raspberries <br>
        600 g (2 ⅔ cups) full-fat cream cheese, room temperature (used Philadelphia cream cheese.) <br>
        115 g (½ cup) full-fat plain or Greek-style yoghurt, room temperature (You can also use sour cream.) <br>
        200 g (1 cup) caster/superfine or granulated sugar <br>
        20 g (3 tbsp) cornflour/cornstarch  <br>
        ½ tsp vanilla bean paste (or 1 tsp vanilla extract) <br>
        3 large eggs, room temperature
        </p>
        <strong>Raspberry Sauce</strong>
        <p>200 g (1 ⅔ cups) fresh or frozen raspberries <br>
        75 g (¼ cup + 2 tbsp) granulated sugar <br>
        240 g (2 cups) fresh raspberries</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For Cheesecake Crust</strong>
        <p>1. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line an 8 inch (20cm) springform pan with baking/greaseproof paper (make sure that you line both the bottom and the sides of the pan). <br>
        2. Mix together the crushed digestive biscuits and melted butter, until you get a mixture resembling wet sand. Transfer the mixture into the lined springform pan and, using the flat bottom of a glass or measuring cup, compress them into an even layer with an approximately 1 ½ inch (4cm) rim around the edge. <br><br>
        <b>Tip 1:</b> Depending on the type and brand of cookies/biscuits you use, you might need slightly less or slightly more butter than listed in this recipe. Add the butter slowly, mixing well after each addition, until you reach the consistency of wet sand. You want a mixture that somewhat sticks together or holds its shape when pressed together, but it shouldn't feel/look greasy or oily. <br>
        3. Bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool until warm.
        </p>
        <strong>For Raspberry Cheesecake Filling</strong>
        <p>1. Reduce the oven temperature to 285ºF (140ºC). <br><br>
        <b>Tip 2:</b> If your springform pan isn't 100% leak-proof, I recommend that you also get a baking sheet ready to place the cheesecake on it before it goes into the oven. This will catch any small leaks of butter from the cheesecake base, and prevent any smoking or burning at the bottom of your oven. <br>
        2. <b>First, make the raspberry reduction:<br></b>
        In a saucepan, cook the raspberries on medium-high heat with occasional stirring until they have softened and released their juices.
        Pass the raspberry mixture through a sieve, and discard the seeds and skins.
        Return the raspberry juice to the saucepan and cook further over medium-high heat with frequent stirring until it has decreased in volume to about ½ cup (about 110 g), this should take about 15 minutes. The final reduction should be thick and viscious, but not quite jam-like.
        Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. <br>
        3. In a large bowl using a balloon whisk, mix the cream cheese and yoghurt together until smooth. <br>
        <b>Tip 3:</b>  Make sure to MIX rather than whisk or aerate - you don't want to incorporate too much air into the mixture. If you don't want to do this by hand, use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on the lowest speed setting. <br>
        4. Mix the sugar and cornflour/cornstarch together, and add them to the cream cheese mixture. Mix well until combined and smooth. <br>
        <b>Tip 4:</b> Mixing the cornflour/cornstarch with the sugar before adding them ensures that the cornflour/cornstarch doesn't clump together in the cheesecake filling. <br>
        5. Add the vanilla bean paste and mix well until evenly incorporated. <br>
        6. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition, until smooth. <br>
        7. Add the cooled raspberry reduction and mix well until evenly incorporated - the cheesecake filling should be of an even pink colour. <br>
        8. Transfer the raspberry cheesecake filling into the slightly cooled cheesecake crust and smooth out the top. <br>
        9. Bake at 285ºF (140ºC) for about 60-65 minutes, or until the edges are fully set and slightly puffed up, and the middle is still wobbly when you gently shake the baking pan. <br>
        <b>Tip 5:</b> This baking time range is merely a guideline - you should always judge the doneness of a cheesecake based on its physical indicators (the wobbliness of the centre, how set the edges are, etc.) rather than on the baking time, especially as each oven behaves slightly differently. You should start checking your cheesecake about 10 minutes before the recommended baking time. <br>
        10. Turn off the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature in the turned-off oven with the oven door afar. <br>
        11. Once cooled to room temperature, transfer the cheesecake into the fridge for at least 4 hours (or preferably overnight) before removing it from the baking pan. Keep it in the fridge until you're ready to assemble/decorate.
        </p>
        <strong>For Raspberry Sauce</strong>
        <p>1. Add the 200g of raspberries (either fresh or frozen) and the sugar to a saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat with occasional stirring until the raspberries have softened and released their juices. <br>
        2. Pass them through a sieve, and discard the seeds and skins. <br>
        3. Return the juices back into the saucepan and cook over medium-high heat with frequent stirring until reduced in volume to about ⅓ cup - they should be very viscous and syrupy, but not quite jam-like, this should take about 10 minutes. Once thickened, set aside to cool. <br>
        <b>Tip 6:</b> I actually prefer to over-reduce (rather than under-reduce) the juices, as you can always add some water back to loosen them up. A too runny sauce, on the other hand, is very messy and difficult to fix (especially once you've mixed in the fresh raspberries). <br>
        4. Mix the cooled reduction with 240 g of the fresh raspberries, adding a small amount of water if you need to loosen it up slightly. Make sure that all the raspberries are evenly coated in the syrup/reduction.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Assembly</strong>
        <p>1. Once the cheesecake is fully chilled, remove it out of the springform pan and onto a serving plate. <br>
        2. Just before serving, spoon over the raspberry sauce, then slice and serve. <br>
        <b>Tip 7:</b> The sauce on top does make cutting the cheesecake slightly messy - so, what you could do is cut the cheesecake without the sauce on top and them spoon it over the individual slices right before serving.</p>

        <p>2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
        2 tablespoons cocoa powder <br>
        1 teaspoon baking powder <br>
        1 teaspoon baking soda <br>

        <b>Spoon & Sweep Method<br></b>
        Use a spoon to fill measuring cup with flour until required amount is obtained. Scooping measuring cup directly into flour bag will firmly pack flour resulting in too much flour required for recipe.
        </p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter and flour (3) 9-inch cake pans and fit a round sheet of parchment on bottoms for easy removal. Set aside.<br> 
        2. Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. <br>
        3. Using a stand or handheld mixer or a sturdy hand whisk, mix oil and eggs until well blended. Add sugar and whisk until completely smooth. <br>
        4. Add buttermilk, vanilla, and food color.  <br> 
        5. Add sifted ingredients in one step and mix until batter is smooth. Do not mix more than necessary. <br>
        6. Add hot water and vinegar and mix until combined. <br>
        7. Divide batter evenly into pans and place in oven. Bake until centers of cakes bounce back when lightly pressed with a finger and the cakes start to retract from the sides in a few areas. About 30 minutes. <br>
        8. Allow to cool for about 5-10 minutes before turning upside down onto plastic food film, a kitchen towel, or parchment paper. Do not remove parchment paper from cakes yet. Let cool before frosting. <br>
        9. For frosting, mix soft cream cheese with soft and lump free butter on low speed. Add vanilla extract. <br>
        10. Gradually add powdered sugar. <br>
        11. Place a cake layer on a serving tray and coat with frosting. Add another layer frost sides and top of cake.

        <p>8 oz strawberries - washed and dried <br>
        <b>Dry Ingredients:<br></b>
        ½ cup cake flour - (65g) sifted <br>
        ¼ cup white sugar - (44g) for egg yolks <br>
        2 ½ Tablespoons white sugar - (37g) for egg whites <br>
        ¼ teaspoon baking powder <br>
        ⅛ teaspoon salt - (½ g) <br>

        3 large eggs - whites and yolks separated <br>
        2 ½ Tablespoons avocado oil - (31g) substitute with neutral vegetable oil <br>
        1 Tablespoon water - (12g) <br>
        1 teaspoon corn syrup - (6g) substitute with honey <br>
        ¼ teaspoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract
        </p>
        <strong>Whipped Cream Frosting</strong>
        <p>2 cups heavy whipping cream - should be cold <br>
        6 to 8 Tablespoons powdered sugar - add more or less depending on taste</p>
        <strong>Cake Syrup</strong>
        <p>3 Tablespoons sugar <br>
        ⅓ cup hot water
        </p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, add together egg yolks, ¼ cup of sugar, salt, corn syrup, vanilla, and water. Beat on high with a stand mixer or hand mixer until fluffy and pale yellow with ribbons form when lifting the whisk. Set aside. <br>
        2. In a large bowl, add the egg whites and beat on high until it starts to get foamy. Start adding the 2½ tablespoons of sugar in three equal parts, beating each time to incorporate. Beat the egg whites on high until firm peaks form. When lifting the whisk from the bowl, the meringue should hold its shape while the tip drops slightly. <br>
        3. Add ½ of the egg white meringue to the egg yolk mixture and gently fold it in until it's mostly mixed in. This should be light and airy. Next, sift the flour and baking powder into the yolk and meringue mixture in three equal parts, gently folding after each time. <br>
        4. Take out 2 Tablespoons of the combined batter from the previous step and mix this with the oil until it's not longer separated. Gently fold the oil mixture into the batter. Next, add the remaining half of the egg white meringue by gently folding it in. <br>
        5. Pour the batter into a round cake pan lined with parchment paper. You can use one 8 inch pan or two 6 inch pans. Bang the pan twice on a flat surface to remove large air bubbles. Bake at 350 degrees F until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. About 15 minutes for two 6 inch pans or 23 to 25 minutes for one 8 inch pan. <br>
        6. Remove the cake from the pan and remove the parchment paper. Let it cool on a cooling rack. <br>
        7. Add the cold heavy cream and powdered sugar into a large mixing bowl and beat it on medium speed until you get medium peaks. Watch it carefully and stop the mixer before it becomes grainy. <br>
        8. Slice the cake into even layers. Make the sugar syrup by dissolving the sugar in the hot water. Then, brush on even amounts of the sugar syrup onto all the layers, including the top layer. <br>
        Cut half of the strawberries into thick slices for the inner layer. Leave the other half whole to decorate the top of the cake. <br>
        9. Apply a layer of cream to the cake sheet and then top it with sliced strawberries. Add another layer of cream on top of the strawberries and followed by another layer of cake. Repeat as necessary.<br>
        Next, frost the top and sides of the cake with whipped cream and decorate as desired. Place whole strawberries on top of the cake, sprinkled with powdered sugar. Serve immediately.

        1 c. chocolate chips <br>
        1 1/2 c. heavy cream, divided <br>
        1/4 c. powdered sugar
        </p>
        <strong>White Chocolate Mousse</strong>
        <p>1 tsp. gelatin <br>
        1 tbsp. cold water <br>
        1 c. white chocolate chips <br>
        1 1/2 c. heavy cream, divided <br>
        1/4 c. powdered sugar <br>
        1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</p>
        <strong>Garnish</strong>
        <p>Chocolate shavings</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350°. Grease an 8” springform pan with cooking spray. Prepare cake mix according to package instructions and pour about half into pan. (Use remaining batter for cupcakes!) Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely in pan. <br> 
        2. Make chocolate mousse: In a small bowl, combine gelatin and water and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 1/2 cup heavy cream to a simmer then remove from heat. Whisk in softened gelatin and stir until completely dissolved. Pour mixture over chocolate chips and whisk until chocolate is melted. Let mixture cool, stirring occasionally. <br>
        3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat remaining cream with powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Stir in about a quarter cup of whipped cream into melted chocolate mixture. Then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream until fully incorporated. <br>
        4. Spread mousse over chocolate cake, smoothing the top with an offset spatula. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. <br> 
        5. Meanwhile, make white chocolate mousse: In a small bowl, combine gelatin and water and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Place chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 1/2 cup heavy cream to a simmer then remove from heat. Whisk in softened gelatin and stir until completely dissolved. Pour mixture over chocolate chips and whisk until chocolate is melted. Let mixture cool, stirring occasionally. <br>
        6. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat remaining 1 cup cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Stir in about a quarter cup of whipped cream into melted white chocolate mixture. Then gently fold in the remaining whipped cream until fully incorporated. <br>
        7. Spread white chocolate mousse over chocolate mousse layer, smoothing the top with an offset spatula. Refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours. <br>
        8. Garnish with chocolate shavings before serving.

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <strong>Cake</strong>

        2½ cups all purpose flour <br>
        2½ tsp baking powder <br>
        ½ tsp salt <br>
        2 tsp vanilla extract <br>
        3/4 cup whole milk <br>
        1/2 cup coconut milk, can <br>
        1 cup sweetened coconut flakes
        </p>
        <strong>Frosting</strong>
        <p>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, room temperature <br>
        8 oz cream cheese, room temperature <br>
        7 oz jar marshmallow fluff <br>
        1 cup powdered sugar <br>
        4 oz baking white chocolate bar
        </p>
        <strong>White Chocolate Garnache</strong>
        <p>4 oz baking white chocolate bar <br>
        ¼ cup heavy whipping cream</p>
        <strong>Topping</strong>
        <p>1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes</p>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <strong>For the Cake</strong>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease and lightly flour 3, 8-inch round baking pans. (To flour the pans: grease with cooking spray then add some flour. Pat baking pan so that it's lightly covered in flour all over the inside, then turn the pan upside down and lightly pat to discard loose flour.) <br>
        2. Have all your ingredients ready. <br>
        3. Beat butter in the electric mixer on high, for about a minute. Add sugar and beat for another minute or two, until light and fluffy. <br>
        4. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on medium-high speed after each addition. Add vanilla extract. <br>
        5. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together. <br>
        6. Lower the speed to low and add a third the flour mixture, mix until just combined. <br>
        7. Add coconut milk, mix just until incorporated. <br>
        8. Add another third of the flour mixture, mix just until incorporated. <br>
        9. Add half the whole milk, mix just until incorporated. <br>
        10. Add remaining flour and after it's just incorporated, add remaining milk. <br>
        11.	Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl and mix until all ingredients are just combined. <br>
        12.	Stir in coconut flakes. <br>
        13.	Separate the batter between the 3 baking pans, evenly. Pat filled baking pans gently on the counter to get rid of any formed air pockets. Bake for 18-22 minutes. Take out and let the cakes rest of the counter for 10 minutes. <br>
        14. Carefully run a butter knife between sides of the cake pan and the cake. Let the cakes cool for about 10 minutes and then take them out of the pans. Let them cool completely on a rack before adding frosting or it will melt.
        </p>
        <strong>For the Frosting</strong>
        <p>1. In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter for a couple of minutes on medium-high speed. Add cream cheese and continue to beat it for 2-3 more minutes. <br>
        2. Meanwhile, melt baking chocolate in a microwave (30-45 at a time, on half the power). Stir and let cool just a little bit. <br>
        3. Lower the speed and add powder sugar, mix until incorporated and raise the speed again. <br>
        4. Add melted white chocolate and marshmallow fluff to the mixing bowl, and mix. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat for a couple extra minutes. (You may want to place the frosting into the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.) <br>
        5. Once the cake layers are cooled completely, <br>
        6. Spread a third of the frosting on the bottom layer of the cake. Top off with another cake layer. <br>
        7. Spread another third of frosting on the bottom of the second cake layer. Top off with the third cake layer. <br>
        8. Spread remaining frosting on top of the third cake layer.
        </p>
        <strong>For the White Chocolate Ganache</strong>
        <p>1. Chop white baking chocolate and place it into a small bowl. <br>
        2. Bring heavy cream to simmer, be careful not to let it actually boil or it will raise. <br>
        3. Pour ¼ cup of boiling cream over the chopped white chocolate and stir with a whisk until melted and smooth. (If you notice your chocolate is not melting as well, pop it into the microwave for 15 seconds on half the power. Whisk until smooth.) <br>
        4. Pour white chocolate ganache over the cake and let it drip down the sides. <br>
        5. Sprinkle coconut flakes over the top of the cake. <br>
        6. I recommend putting the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours to settle. (To secure the layers, you can stick a long wooden skewer in the center of the cake.
